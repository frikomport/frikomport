# Just a simple GNU make wrapper around the Dockerized ant processes.
# Why make? Well, we're pretty much just using it as a big switch-case block, so it's not really used for the build.
# It has little in the terms of dependencies, and is already available on most *nix-based systems. We're using it
# as a simple alternative to having a bunch of bash scripts for all the tasks. There's no logic in this file, 
# only mappings between the Docker containers and parametrizations... --henhed
