Changes from 2.0.2 to 2.0.3 - released 2010/??/??

*General:
- Cluster support is back, for eZ Publish versions 4.1.0 to 4.2.0 (no ezfsdb yet)
- added update script up to eZ Publish version 4.3.0rc1
- vastly improved the consistency checks and the generated corrective sql in the "Setup"/"System upgrade check" page
  To take full advantage of the improvements, you should use eZ Publish 4.1.5+, 4.2.1+ or 4.3.0+
  For lower versions in the 4.1 and 4.2 series a patched kernel/setup/systemupgrade.php script
  is available in the 'patches' directory of the extension.

- Fixed bug #016203: update scripts from eZP 4.0 to 4.1 would leave EZCOBJ_STATE_GROUP_LANGUAGE.DESCRIPTION and EZCOBJ_STATE_LANGUAGE.DESCRIPTION not null, making it impossible to have empty descriptions in object states groups
